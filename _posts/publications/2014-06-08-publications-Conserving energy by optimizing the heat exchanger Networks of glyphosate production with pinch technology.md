Abstract

China is one of the largest glyphosate producers in the world. The production process consumes a large amount of energy and discharges a huge volume of wastewater. In the glyphosate production system, the by-product recovery process consumes the largest amount of energy. To conserve energy consumption and minimize wastewater discharge, the study applies pinch technology to optimize the heat exchanger network of the by-product recovery subsystem. The results show that the optimal temperature for the process is 8°C. Theoretically, the optimized heat exchanger network has the potential to reduce the annual consumption of steam, condensed water, and the freshwater resource by 1.53, 26.84 and 56.72%, respectively, when compared with current consumption levels. At the same time, the total annual cost can be reduced by 100,000 dollars per year, which means that the optimization can achieve the win–win objective of the economic and environmental benefits in the glyphosate production process.
