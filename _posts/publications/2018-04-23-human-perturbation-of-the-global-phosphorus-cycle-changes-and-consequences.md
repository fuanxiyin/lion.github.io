excerpt: The phosphorus (P) cycle is an important Earth system process. While natural
  P mobilization is slow, humans have been altering P cycle by intensifying P releases
  from lithosphere to ecosystems. Here, we examined magnitudes of which humans have
  altered the P cycles by integrating the estimates from recent literatures, and furthermore
  illustrated the consequences. Based on our synthesis, human alterations have tripled
  the global P mobilization in land-water continuum and increased P accumulation in
  soil with 6.9 ± 3.3 Tg-P yr–1. Around 30% of atmospheric P transfer is caused by
  human activities, which plays a significant role than previously thought. Pathways
  involving with human alterations include phosphate extraction, fertilizers application,
  wastes generation, and P losses from cropland. This study highlights the importance
  of sustainable P supply as a control on future food security because of regional
  P scarcity, food demand increase and continuously P intensive food production. Besides,
  accelerated P loads are responsible for enhanced eutrophication worldwide, resulting
  in water quality impairment and aquatic biodiversity losses. Moreover, the P enrichment
  can definitely stimulate the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, implying the great
  need for incorporating P in models predicting the response of carbon and nitrogen
  cycles to global changes.

Abstract

The phosphorus (P) cycle is an important Earth system process. While natural P mobilization is slow, humans have been altering P cycle by intensifying P releases from lithosphere to ecosystems. Here, we examined magnitudes of which humans have altered the P cycles by integrating the estimates from recent literatures, and furthermore illustrated the consequences. Based on our synthesis, human alterations have tripled the global P mobilization in land-water continuum and increased P accumulation in soil with 6.9 ± 3.3 Tg-P yr–1. Around 30% of atmospheric P transfer is caused by human activities, which plays a significant role than previously thought. Pathways involving with human alterations include phosphate extraction, fertilizers application, wastes generation, and P losses from cropland. This study highlights the importance of sustainable P supply as a control on future food security because of regional P scarcity, food demand increase and continuously P intensive food production. Besides, accelerated P loads are responsible for enhanced eutrophication worldwide, resulting in water quality impairment and aquatic biodiversity losses. Moreover, the P enrichment can definitely stimulate the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, implying the great need for incorporating P in models predicting the response of carbon and nitrogen cycles to global changes.
