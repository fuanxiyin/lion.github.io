Abstract
Shanghai is the largest industrial and commercial city of China, where in-use stocks of metals are likelyto be significant. The in-use stocks of copper in this city are thus established by an extensive “bottom-up”study. Spatial distribution of copper stocks within Shanghai has further been characterized for betterunderstanding of copper utilization pattern of this city. For the year 2012, the results are a total stock of914.6 Gg Cu, and 38.4–64.1 kg Cu per capita. Nearly 94% of copper stocks distribute in subcategories ofelectric power transmission and distribution, water transmission and distribution, buildings, and house-hold durable. Features of spatial distribution show that three central districts of Jing An, Hong Kou andHuang Pu have the spatial density of more than 1 Gg/km2. And Chong Ming county and Jin Shan Districthave the lowest spatial density of about 0.01 Gg/km2. It has been found that the copper stock densitywithin Shanghai is largely determined by population density and economic development level.
