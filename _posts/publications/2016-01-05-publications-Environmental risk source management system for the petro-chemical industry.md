Abstract

We identify environmental risk sources within the petrochemical industry with a bow-tie analysis, evaluate environmental risk sources with an integrated environmental risk assessment index, and classify environmental risk sources considering both environmental consequences and management costs. Furthermore, we develop a routine management system for environmental risk sources based on browser/server model and web-GIS technology. The system has four main functions: petrochemical enterprise registration and declaration, environmental risk source information correction and confirmation, environmental risk source evaluation and classification, and environmental risk source management. The system runs with the following sequential steps. (1) Petrochemical enterprises register and declare their environmental risk source information. (2) The registered environmental risk source information is checked, corrected and confirmed by local environmental officials. (3) The probability and intensity of environmental risk are calculated for all registered petrochemical factories. (4) All environmental risk sources are classified into high, medium and low risk sections based on their potential regional environmental and ecological impacts. (5) The system provides recommendations on the routine risk management based on empirical expert opinions. The software provides an effective tool for safety production of petrochemical enterprises and can be applied by local governments for environmental risk source management.
