Abstract

Anthropogenic phosphorus load in the aquatic environment of Lujiang County, central China, may be a serious problem, greatly contributing to surface water eutrophication. Using substance flow analysis, this study develops a phosphorus-flow analytical model to trace the pathways of this limiting nutrient throughout Lujiang's socioeconomic system. The model includes six major subsystems: extraction, phosphorous chemical industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, human consumption, and phosphorous waste management. We conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses of the primary phosphorous flows and stocks within these subsystems in Lujiang County over 2008. Approaches to data include statistical reports and literature reviews, face-to-face interviews and questionnaire-based surveys. The results show the total phosphorus input and output were 8311.5 tons and 5664.6 tons, respectively, in Lujiang in 2008, resulting in a phosphorus surplus of 2646.9 tons in the socioeconomic system. The phosphorus load in the recipient waters, as part of the total phosphorus output, was estimated to be 1666.7 tons. Large-scale livestock operations contributed the most phosphorus to local surface waters, accounting for 55.8% and followed by human consumption (23.0%) and agriculture (21.2%). Consequently, it should be of central concern for policy makers to improve phosphorous reuse efficiency in order to reduce phosphorus release into the aquatic environment. Limitations of the methodology and data are also discussed.
