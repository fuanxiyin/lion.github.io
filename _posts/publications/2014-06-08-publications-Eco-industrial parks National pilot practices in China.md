Abstract

China has rapidly developed a number of Eco-industrial parks (EIPs) in recent years. In order to promote and regulate their development, two government agencies, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the National Development and Reform Commission are currently engaged in promoting national pilot EIP programs. Both agencies have developed their own management systems, and 60 industrial parks have been approved for construction of national pilot EIPs, among which six parks appear in both lists of the two agencies. This article introduces the practice of the national pilot EIPs. It first describes the management systems and achievements within the two programs, and then summarizes the problems encountered thus far in program implementation. Finally it proposes brief suggestions for future development of EIPs.
