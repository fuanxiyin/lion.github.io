Abstract

Human activities disturb the long-term phosphorus (P) cycle in nature, whereby the resulting intensive release of P contributes to the eutrophication of surface water. Hence, a detailed understanding of P flow as it relates to socioeconomic systems is essential for effective nutrient management. This study develops a substance-flow-analysis model for P metabolism for the socioeconomic ecosystem of Shucheng County in Anhui Province in central China as a case study. We estimate P flow using data from questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, published literature, and official statistical databases. Our results show that P flow in Shucheng's current socioeconomic system is linear and openly metabolic. The total P input into Shucheng in 2008 reached 12 748 Mg, mainly as P ores and crops. In all, 43.83% of the total P input was exported, and 30.44% was discharged into surface water. More-balanced nutrient management and options for improving nutrient use efficiency are discussed. The quantifiable, science-based methods used in this study may be applied to neighboring regions of central China for sustainable development and water management.
