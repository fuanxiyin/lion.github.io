       **Nanjing University (China)**, a member institution of the United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI), is organizing the **25th International Sustainable Development Research Society Conference** that will be held from 25 - 28 June 2019 in Nanjing, China with the theme "Sustaing Resources for the Future". The Conference will explore the fundamental question of how to sustain current development without stripping the resources that the future needs, including biological and mineral resources as well as a well-functioning ecosystem. How could the academic progress in sustainable development be translated into a workable plan for action through a dialogue between scholars and stakeholders? This Conference would like to create such an exchange opportunity among conference attendees, decision makers, policymakers, and the private sector.

       The academic event aims to illustrate the significant gap between resource demand and supply and its serious concequences in future if society fails to figure out and in addition, carry on an effective way of using all the resources sustainably. Moreover, the organizers want to bring together the enthusiastic scientific experts, scholars as well as practioners from all over the world to share their most recent research findings, practical experiences and unique insights, to provide a global platform for promoting and strengthening the scientific and practical collaborations around the world and to develop a conference programme that reflects the diversity within the research of strategies and solutions to sustaining the resources for the future. Several core themes and tracks will be addressed during the Conference, like education for sustainability.
